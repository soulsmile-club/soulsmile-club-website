What is Soulsmile Club?|Soulsmile Club introduces a new way to donate without spending extra. When you shop through our affiliate links, Soulsmile Club earns commission, also known as soulsmiles. Instead of keeping it, we donate ALL proceeds to the causes listed on our site. By using Soulsmile Club, you can bring real financial support to worthy social causes, without spending extra.
Where do soulsmiles come from? Why are retailers willing to give up a percentage of the sales?|Soulsmile Club makes use of a widespread marketing practice called affiliate marketing. Affiliates (think Instagram influencers, famous bloggers etc.) channel traffic and sales for brands and get a commission off qualifying purchases. You can think of Soulsmile Club like an influencer. Every time you click through a shopping link from Soulsmile Club and make a qualifying purchase, Soulsmile Club receives a commission ranging from 3-5% of the purchase. However, instead of keeping the commission, we donate it to the causes listed on our site.
How does Soulsmile Club make money? Is it a non-profit?|Soulsmile Club is a registered non-profit organization. For non-profit organizations who join Soulsmile Club now, there are currently no fees. We also donate the commissions we earn entirely to the social causes. However, we do have a business model to sustain ourselves in the long run. Similar to other giving platform like Patreon, Soulsmile Club plans to collect a membership fee from organizations who join us later on.
