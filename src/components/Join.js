                <p className="join-body">Soulsmile Club is a tech nonprofit started by Penn alums that seeks to combine philanthropy with everyday consumerism to make the world happier. Soulsmile Club is currently a Chrome browser extension that allows you to donate without spending extra when shopping online â€“ like Honey for social good, in short. Currently, the Soulsmile extension works with over 90 retailers. </p>

                <p className="join-header">How Does Soulsmile Club Work</p>
                <p className="join-body">When you shop online through our banners or our browser extension, Soulsmile Club earns commission, also known as soulsmiles, on your qualifying purchases as a "thank you" from the retailer. Instead of keeping them, we direct all the commission we receive towards organizations working on the most pressing humanitarian issues today. This way, you can give back to your community without spending extra, and impactful organizations can get real financial support. </p>
